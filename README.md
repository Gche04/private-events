# Private-events

This is a ruby on rails project which is part of the Odin project online course,
can be found at https://www.theodinproject.com

In this project we want to build a site similiar to a private Eventbrite which allows users to create events and then manage user signups.

A user can create events. A user can attend many events. An event can be attended by many users. Events take place at a specific date and at a location.
